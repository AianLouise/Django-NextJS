# ✅ Organization-Based Registration Implementation Complete

## What Was Updated

The user registration system has been successfully transformed from individual account creation to organization-based team signup with the following implementation:

### 🏗️ **Database Models**
- **New `Organization` Model**: Stores company information, settings, and user limits
- **Enhanced `CustomUser` Model**: Added organization relationship, user roles, and invitation tracking
- **Database Migration**: Successfully applied changes with zero downtime

### 🔧 **API Endpoints**
- **`POST /api/users/organization/register/`** - Create organization + owner account
- **`POST /api/users/organization/invite/`** - Invite team members (owners/admins only)
- **`POST /api/users/invitation/accept/`** - Accept invitations and activate accounts
- **`GET /api/users/organization/team/`** - View organization team members
- **Backward compatibility maintained** - Original `/register/` endpoint still works

### 🔐 **Security Features**
- **Role-based permissions** (Owner, Admin, Manager, Employee)
- **Invitation-only team joining** with secure UUID tokens
- **Organization isolation** - users only see their team members
- **User limits** - configurable maximum team size per organization

### 📊 **User Experience Flow**

#### New Primary Flow: "Sign Up - Create an account for your organization and add your team members"

1. **Organization Owner Signs Up**
   ```
   POST /api/users/organization/register/
   → Creates organization + owner account
   → Returns authentication token
   ```

2. **Owner Invites Team Members**
   ```
   POST /api/users/organization/invite/
   → Creates inactive user with invitation token
   → Returns invitation details (would trigger email in production)
   ```

3. **Team Members Accept Invitations**
   ```
   POST /api/users/invitation/accept/
   → Activates account with user-chosen credentials
   → Joins the organization team
   ```

4. **Team Management**
   ```
   GET /api/users/organization/team/
   → View active members and pending invitations
   → Manage team roles and permissions
   ```

### 🧪 **Testing Results**
All functionality has been tested and verified working:
- ✅ Organization creation with owner account
- ✅ Team member invitation by authorized users
- ✅ Invitation acceptance and account activation  
- ✅ Organization team management and viewing
